Scaling data . In order to use distance-based algorithms, which use distance between data points to determine similarity, I will have to scale the data to a closer range. Tree-based algorithms are fairly insensitive to the scaling of data since it only splits a node based on a single feature. Additionally, scaling the data will make results and models more interpretable, as you will more clearly be able to explain the strength of a particular feature determined by the value of its coefficient for the target variable. . I will use standardisation (Z-score normalisation) in order to rescale the dataset, calculated by the formula: $$x&#39; = frac{x- mu}{ sigma}$$ Where, $ mu$: mean of the dataset $ sigma$: standard deviation of the dataset . The standardised data will have zero mean and unit variance, therefore it will allow comparison between different features, which would usually have different unit scales. It is important I compute the mean and standard deviation using only the train set, as using the entire dataset could cause unintentional data leakage to the prediction model, i.e it could unintentionally provide information about unobserved data. . Another method I may try is normalisation or min-max scaling which rescales data to a given range. It is calculated with the formula: $$x&#39; = a + frac{(x-min(x))(b-a)}{max(x)-min(x)}$$ Where, $[a,b]$: interval in which the dataset will be scaled . Again, the min and max values should be computed using only the train set to prevent any unintentional data leakage to the prediction model. . class Scaler: def __init__(self): pass # ============ Fitting ============ def fit(self, x): self._fit = np.array(x) # Fitting an array type for scaling return self def fit_transform(self, x, method=&quot;standardise&quot;, **kwargs): return self.fit(x), self.scale(x, method, **kwargs) # ============ Standardisation ============ def standardise(self, x): self._mean = self._fit.mean(axis=0) self._std = self._fit.std(axis=0) return (np.array(x) - self._mean)/self._std def inv_standardise(self,x): return np.array(x) * self._std + self._mean # ============ Normalisation/Min-Max scaling ============ def min_max(self, x, feature_range=(0,1)): assert len(feature_range) == 2, f&quot;Provide only 2 values for feature_range instead of {len(feature_range)} values&quot; self._a, self._b = feature_range self._min = self._fit.min(axis=0) self._max = self._fit.max(axis=0) return ((np.array(x)-self._min)*(self._b-self._a))/(self._max-self._min) + self._a def inv_min_max(self,x): return ((np.array(x)-self._a)*(self._max-self._min))/(self._b-self._a) + self._min # ============ General scaling ============ def scale(self, x, method:str=&quot;standardise&quot;, **kwargs): scale_method = { &quot;standardise&quot;:self.standardise, &quot;zscore&quot;:self.standardise, &quot;min_max&quot;:self.min_max, &quot;normalise&quot;:self.min_max, }[method] return scale_method(x) def inv(self, x, method=&quot;standardise&quot;,**kwargs): inv_method = { &quot;standardise&quot;:self.inv_standardise, &quot;zscore&quot;:self.inv_standardise, &quot;min_max&quot;:self.inv_min_max, &quot;normalise&quot;:self.inv_min_max, }[method] return inv_method(x) # ============ Serializing scaler ============ def serialize(self, names): serialized = {} if self._fit.ndim == 2: for i,name in enumerate(names): if hasattr(self, &quot;_mean&quot;): serialized[name] = { &quot;mean&quot;: self._mean[i], &quot;std&quot;: self._std[i] } if hasattr(self, &quot;_min&quot;): serialized[name] = { &quot;min&quot;: self._min[i], &quot;max&quot;: self._max[i] } else: if hasattr(self, &quot;_mean&quot;): serialized[names] = { &quot;mean&quot;: self._mean, &quot;std&quot;: self._std } if hasattr(self, &quot;_min&quot;): serialized[names] = { &quot;min&quot;: self._min, &quot;max&quot;: self._max } if hasattr(self,&quot;_a&quot;): serialized[&quot;minmax_range&quot;] = [self._a, self._b] return serialized . sample = df.sample(n=100_000) sample_std = Scaler().fit_transform(sample, method=&quot;standardise&quot;)[1] sample_norm = Scaler().fit_transform(sample, method=&quot;normalise&quot;)[1] f, axs = plt.subplots(1,3,sharey=True) sns.violinplot(data=sample.values, scale=&quot;width&quot;, orient=&quot;h&quot;, ax=axs[0]).set_xlabel(&quot;Original&quot;) sns.violinplot(data=sample_std, scale=&quot;width&quot;, orient=&quot;h&quot;, ax=axs[1]).set_xlabel(&quot;Standardised&quot;) sns.violinplot(data=sample_norm, scale=&quot;width&quot;, orient=&quot;h&quot;, ax=axs[2]).set_xlabel(&quot;Normalised&quot;) axs[0].set_xlim(-10, 125) axs[0].set_yticklabels([col[:6]+&quot;...&quot; if len(col) &gt; 9 else col for col in sample.columns]) axs[0].tick_params(&quot;y&quot;, labelsize=&quot;small&quot;) .

Model selection . Some of the metrics that will be used in evaluating models: . Mean Absolute Error. Lower is better. $$ textit{MAE}= frac {1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} left|y_i- hat{y}_i right|$$ | Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Lower is better. $$ textit{MAPE}= frac {100}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} left| frac {y_i- hat{y}_i}{y_i} right|$$ | Root Mean Squared Error - error is in the same unit as the dependent variable. MSE &amp; RMSE are useful for checking the effect of outliers on the predictions. Lower is better. $$ textit{RMSE} = sqrt{ textit{mean of squares of residuals}} = sqrt{ frac {1}{n} sum _{i=1}^n(y_i-{ hat{y}_i})^2}$$ | RÂ² score - measures how well the predictors in the model explain the variability in the criterion (dependent variable). Best possible score is 1, higher is better. A negative score will reflect that the model is objectively worse at explaining the variability. $$R^2 = 1 - frac{ textit{sum of squares of residuals}}{ textit{sum of total squares}} = 1- frac{ sum_{i=1}^n(y_i- hat{y}_i)^2}{ sum_{i=1}^n({y_i - bar{y})^2}}$$ | . Where, $y$: expected value $ hat{y}$: predicted value $ bar{y}$: mean of expected values . Conformal Prediction .

Multiple Linear Regression . Initally, I will begin by fitting a multiple linear regression model on my data. I expect this to perform poorly, as the linear regression will not capture the complex relationships and will assume linearity between the multiple predictor variables and the target variable. . Implementation . # algorithms/linear_regression/__init__.py class LinearRegression: @staticmethod def loss_fn(y,yhat): return np.mean(np.square(yhat-y)) def __init__(self, lr:float=.01): self.lr=lr self.history = None self.bias = 0 def predict(self,X:ndarray): return X.dot(self.weights) + self.bias # y = w.x + b def fit(self, X:ndarray, y:ndarray, val_X:ndarray=None, val_y:ndarray=None, epochs:int=1000, early_stopping:int=50, delta:float=0.01, verbose:bool=True ): X,y = np.asarray(X), np.asarray(y) self.weights = np.zeros(X.shape[1]) self.history = dict(loss=list()) if val_X is not None and val_y is not None: self.history[&quot;val_loss&quot;] = [] val_X, val_y = np.asarray(val_X), np.asarray(val_y) patience = None if isinstance(early_stopping, int) and early_stopping &gt; 0: patience = early_stopping best_loss = np.inf for i in (pbar:=tqdm(range(epochs), disable=not verbose)): if patience is not None and patience &lt;= 0: break yhat = self.predict(X) # cost gradient wrt params weight_grad = np.dot(X.T, yhat-y) / len(y) # gradient of loss wrt weights bias_grad = np.mean(yhat-y) # gradient of loss wrt bias # updating params (stochastic gradient descent) self.weights -= self.lr * weight_grad self.bias -= self.lr * bias_grad loss = self.loss_fn(y,yhat) self.history[&quot;loss&quot;].append(loss) # testing model on validation set if provided if &quot;val_loss&quot; in self.history: self.history[&quot;val_loss&quot;].append(self.loss_fn(val_y,self.predict(val_X))) # logging epoch info if enabled if verbose: msg = {&quot;loss&quot;: self.history[&quot;loss&quot;][-1]} if &quot;val_loss&quot; in self.history: msg[&quot;val_loss&quot;] = self.history[&quot;val_loss&quot;][-1] if patience is not None: msg[&quot;patience&quot;] = patience pbar.set_postfix(msg) # skip to next iteration if early stopping is disabled if patience is None: continue # if model has improved greater than minimum delta if best_loss - loss &gt;= delta: patience = early_stopping # reset patience best_loss = loss continue # skip to next iteration patience -= 1 # decrement patience (code wont be reached if model improved) return self . . Fitting and evaluating . fn = &quot;models/LinearRegression.bin&quot; if not os.path.exists(fn): reg = LinearRegression().fit(tr_X, tr_y, val_X=val_X, val_y=val_y) dump(reg, fn) reg = ConformalRegression(load(fn)).calibrate(cal_X, cal_y) . MAE (78,682) is 35.49% of mean RMSE (117,887) is 53.18% of mean MAPE 47.35% R2 Score is 0.479 . The model performed better than expected, however it still wasn&#39;t great. We can begin to see which features have the most importance, such as the total floor area and location data. I will avoid other linear models, as they will likely perform similarly, and will instead try neighbour and tree-based methods instead. . K-Nearest Neighbour . I will now try the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to test if the distances between points, especially in their coordinates, can significantly impact the outcome price. The KNN algorithm works by using feature similarity to predict the values of new unseen data. A new point is assigned a value based on how closely it resembles other points in the training set, i.e the distance between them. The distance can be calculated using the Euclidean distance, or other methods such as the Manhattan, or Chebyzchev, distance. It then sorts the points and aggregrates the closest points for the outcome. This could be majority voting for classification, or the neighbourhood average for regression. The model is very sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, where adding more features doesn&#39;t benefit the model, rather it adds noise and hinders its performance. . Implementation . I will implement a custom model that utilises cuML&#39;s nearest neighbour search that will return the prediction as the inverse distance weighted average of the nearest neighbours, which will favour closer points. $$ bar x = frac{ sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{ sum_{i=1}^nw_i} textrm{ where } w_i = frac{1}{d_{ix}^p} $$ To avoid zero division errors, I will only compute the weights of non-zero rows and will fill any remaining rows with a weights of 1 for zero distance, and 0 for all other distances. Since a distance of zero means an output sample is identical to the user&#39;s input, setting all other weights to 0 will solely favour the zero-distance sample for the output. To illustrate: . distance matrix = [[0.1, 0.4, 1.2, 2.1], [0.0, 0.2, 1.3, 1.9], [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1], [0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1.1]] weights(distance matrix) = [[100, 6.25, 0.69, 0.22], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [4.0, 2.78, 1.23, 0.83]] . # algorithms/knn/__init__.py class KNNRegressor(object): def __init__(self, n_neighbours:int=5, idw_power:int=1): self.n_neighbours_ = n_neighbours self.idw_power_ = idw_power def fit(self, X, y, **kwargs): self.fit_X_ = X self.fit_y_ = y self.nearest_neigh_ = NearestNeighbors(**kwargs) self.nearest_neigh_.fit(X) return self def weights_fn(self, dist): weights = np.empty_like(dist) # masking all non-zero distance samples non_zero = np.all(dist!=0, axis=1) # setting non-zero weights to 1/dist^p weights[non_zero] = 1 / np.power(dist[non_zero], self.idw_power_ ) # binary mapping zero distance to 1 and 0 for all other. weights[~non_zero] = (dist[~non_zero] == 0).astype(float) return weights def predict(self, X): # getting k nearest neighbours dist, idx = self.nearest_neigh_.kneighbors(X, self.n_neighbours_) return np.average(self.fit_y_[idx], axis=1, weights=self.weights_fn(dist)) . .

MAE (63,421) is 28.61% of mean RMSE (103,374) is 46.63% of mean MAPE 21.28% R2 Score is 0.767 . Decision Tree regression . Now, I will attempt to implement a regression tree. I expect that the model will not perform well on its own, and I will probably need to use an ensemble method for best performance. My implementation will probably also be inefficient and will take a considerable amount of time in training, as I will be using recursion and expensive computations to build the tree. Additionally, I will suffer Python&#39;s various bottlenecks and overhead, where better, more established implementations use C++ instead. .

MAE (81,266) is 36.66% of mean RMSE (125,512) is 56.62% of mean MAPE 28.47% R2 Score is 0.657 . As seen above, the model produces discrete predictions based on the leaf nodes of the fitted tree. I believe increasing the maximum depth (thereby increasing the number of leaves) would help improve the bands of predictions that can be seen on the scatter diagram. However, this would be highly inefficient due to the limitations of my implementation. Therefore, I will instead try using an ensemble method to combine multiple trees, which will possibly reduce the issues faced. . Random Forest . Hyperparameter optimisation . I will begin by optimising the random forest&#39;s parameters on a small set of data, with a low number of estimators, for quick and effective computation. The models will be optimised to minimise the RMSE (root mean squared error) of the predictions. I will be running the optimisation over 100 iterations. I will be using the hyperopt library which will make this process rapid and reliable. . pbounds = { &quot;max_depth&quot;: hp.uniformint(&quot;max_depth&quot;, 5, 20), # maximum depth to grow trees to, too high/low could result in overfitting/underfitting &quot;max_features&quot;: hp.uniform(&quot;max_features&quot;, 0.5, 1.0), # maximum number of features to consider when making splits &quot;min_samples_split&quot;: hp.uniformint(&quot;min_samples_split&quot;, 1, 64), # minimum number of samples required to split &quot;min_samples_leaf&quot;: hp.uniformint(&quot;min_samples_leaf&quot;, 1, 64), # minimum number of samples in each leaf node # static parameters &quot;n_bins&quot;:256, &quot;n_estimators&quot;: 50, # number of trees to build. low number for now, will increase when fitting resulting model &quot;random_state&quot;: SEED # for reproducibility, may still have some randomness due to n_streams &gt; 1. } n = 100_000 idx = np.random.permutation(len(tr_X))[:n] sample_x, sample_y = tr_X[idx,1:].astype(np.float32), tr_y2[idx].astype(np.float32) . fn = &quot;models/_rf_trials.hyperopt&quot; trials = Trials() if not os.path.exists(fn) else load(fn) result = fmin( fn = objective( model = RandomForestRegressor, X = sample_x, y = sample_y, cv = 5, ), space = pbounds, algo = tpe.suggest, max_evals = 100, trials = trials ) if not os.path.exists(fn): dump(trials, fn) rfparams = {k:v[0] for k,v in trials.best_trial[&quot;misc&quot;][&quot;vals&quot;].items()} rfparams[&quot;max_depth&quot;] = int(rfparams[&quot;max_depth&quot;]) rfparams[&quot;min_samples_split&quot;] = int(rfparams[&quot;min_samples_split&quot;]) rfparams[&quot;min_samples_leaf&quot;] = int(rfparams[&quot;min_samples_leaf&quot;]) . 100%|ââââââââââ| 100/100 [00:00&lt;?, ?trial/s, best loss=?] . best loss: 0.2328524947166443, params: {&#39;max_depth&#39;: 20, &#39;max_features&#39;: 0.9965555438979297, &#39;min_samples_leaf&#39;: 6, &#39;min_samples_split&#39;: 7} .

I will now test gradient boosting machines (XGBoost) accelerated with treelite and ForestInference, to test if it can also perform with similar efficiency. . Gradient Boosting Machine .

Now, I will try implementing and testing a multilayer perceptron, or neural network, completely from scratch, and see whether it can also perform to this level. If my implementation does not perform well, I will retry with Tensorflow and Keras to determine whether it was the model&#39;s unideal performance, or a fault within my code. . Multilayer Perceptron . Implementation . I will be implementing the multilayer perceptron through a modular layer-based implementation. . # algorithms/mlp/base.py NDArrayFunction = Callable[[ndarray], ndarray] LossFunction = Callable[[ndarray, ndarray], ndarray] WeightsInitFunction = Callable[[int, int], ndarray] class BaseOptimiser(object): def __init__(self): # self.reset() pass def reset(self): raise NotImplementedError() def update(self, grad:ndarray, id:str) -&gt; ndarray: raise NotImplementedError() class BaseLayer(object): def __init__(self, id:str=None): self.id = id # self.reset() def reset(self): self.inp = None def forward(self, inp:ndarray) -&gt; ndarray: raise NotImplementedError() def backward(self, grad:ndarray, optimiser:BaseOptimiser) -&gt; ndarray: raise NotImplementedError() class ActivationLayer(BaseLayer): def __init__(self, fn:NDArrayFunction, prime:NDArrayFunction, id:str=None): super().__init__(id) self.fn = fn self.prime = prime def forward(self, inp): self.inp = inp # storing x for back propagation return self.fn(inp) def backward(self, grad, optimiser): # optimiser parameter for consistency, will not be used return self.prime(self.inp) * grad # hadamard product - applying chain rule . . Layers . Each layer type will be implemented with a forward and backward methods. The forward method will feed input through the network, applying the current layer&#39;s function on the previous&#39; output. And the backward method will propagate the loss back through the network, updating trainable parameters along the way. I will only be implementing 2 layer types, the perceptron layer, with trainable weights, and the leaky ReLU non-linear activation function. . I will use Xavier or He initialisation for the weights: $$ text{Xavier}: W sim N left(0, frac 2{n_{in} + n_{out}} right) text{He}: W sim N left(0, frac 2{n_{in}} right) $$ Where, $N( mu, sigma^2)$: normal distribution with mean $ mu$ and variance $ sigma^2$ Since I will be using the leaky ReLU activation, I will likely use He initialisation. . The leaky ReLU activation function can be expressed as: $$ sigma(x) = begin{cases} x&amp; quad x ge 0 cx&amp; quad x &lt; 0 end{cases} sigma&#39;(x) = begin{cases} 1&amp; quad x &gt; 0 c&amp; quad x &lt; 0 DNE&amp; quad x = 0 end{cases} $$ Where, $c$: constant parameter, typically $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$ While the leaky ReLU function is non-differentiable at $x = 0$, it is relatively rare in the context of deep learning and can thus be set arbitrarily, typically to c or 1. . # algorithms/mlp/layers.py class PerceptronLayer(BaseLayer): @staticmethod def xavier_init(n_in, n_out, seed=None): np.random.seed(seed) return np.random.normal( loc = 0.0, scale = np.sqrt(2/(n_in + n_out)), size = (n_in, n_out), ) @staticmethod def he_init(n_in, n_out, seed=None): np.random.seed(seed) return np.random.normal( loc = 0.0, scale = np.sqrt(2/n_in), size = (n_in, n_out), ) def __init__(self, n_in:int, n_out:int, weights_init:Union[str,WeightsInitFunction]=&quot;he&quot;, add_bias=True, id:str=None, seed=None): super().__init__(id) self.seed = seed self.n_in = n_in self.n_out = n_out self.add_bias = add_bias options = { &quot;he&quot;:self.he_init, &quot;kaiming&quot;:self.he_init, &quot;xavier&quot;:self.xavier_init, &quot;glorot&quot;:self.xavier_init, } self.weights_init = options.get(weights_init,weights_init) if not callable(self.weights_init): raise ValueError(f&quot;`weights_init` must be a string in {set(options.keys())} or callable(n_in, n_out, seed):ndarray[n_in, n_out]&quot;) self.reset() def reset(self): super().reset() # initialise weights self.weights = self.weights_init(self.n_in, self.n_out, self.seed) self.bias = np.zeros((1,self.n_out)) def forward(self, inp): self.inp = inp # storing input for back propagation return np.dot(self.inp, self.weights) + self.bias # y = w.x + b def backward(self, grad, optimiser): grad_inp = np.dot(grad, self.weights.T) # gradient of loss wrt input for backpropagation grad_weights = np.dot(self.inp.T, grad) # gradient of loss wrt weights grad_bias = np.mean(grad, axis=0) # gradient of loss wrt bias self.weights -= optimiser.update(grad_weights, self.id+&quot;weights&quot;) if self.add_bias: self.bias -= optimiser.update(grad_bias, self.id+&quot;bias&quot;) return grad_inp class LeakyReLU(ActivationLayer): def __init__(self, alpha:float, id:str=None): self.alpha = alpha super().__init__(self.fn, self.prime, id) def fn(self, inp): # x &gt;= 0: x # x &lt; 0: x * alpha return np.maximum(inp, self.alpha*inp) def prime(self, inp): # x &gt;= 0: 1 # x &lt; 0: alpha return np.where(inp &lt; 0, self.alpha, np.ones_like(inp)) . . Parameter optimisation . I will be optimising trainable parameters using Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimisation which utilises momentum to make the gradient descent algorithm converge towards the minima faster. . $$ m := beta_1 m + (1 - beta_1)g v := beta_2 v + (1 - beta_2)g^2 $$$m$ and $v$ are the first (mean) and second (uncentered variance) moment estimates of the gradient $g$. As $m$ and $v$ are initialised as 0, they are biased towards zero, especially during the initial time steps and when the decay rates are small. Therefore, to counteract these biases, we need to compute bias-corrected first and second moment estimates: $$ hat m = frac{m}{1-( beta_1)^t} quad quad hat v = frac{v}{1-( beta_2)^t} $$ Finally we can update parameter $ phi$: $$ phi := phi - frac{ eta}{ sqrt{ hat v_t}+ epsilon} hat m_t $$ Where, $ phi$: Objective parameter $g$: Gradient of some cost function w.r.t to the objective parameter $m$: first moment (mean) estimate - initialised at 0 $v$: second moment (variance) estimate - initialised at 0 $t$: time step - intialised at 1, incremented after each iteration $ eta$: initial learning rate $ beta_1$: first moment estimate coefficient - default 0.9 $ beta_2$: second moment estimate coefficient - default 0.999 $ epsilon$: term to avoid zero division - default $10^{-8}$ . # algorithms/mlp/optimisers.py class AdamOptimiser(BaseOptimiser): def __init__(self, lr:float=0.01, beta1:float=0.9, beta2:float=0.999, eps:float=1e-8): self.lr = lr self.beta1 = beta1 self.beta2 = beta2 self.eps = eps self.reset() def reset(self): self.cache_m = dict() self.cache_v = dict() self.cache_t = dict() def update(self, grad, id): # retrieve previous iteration variables m = self.cache_m.get(id, 0) v = self.cache_v.get(id, 0) t = self.cache_t.get(id, 1) # update variables for current iteration self.cache_m[id] = self.beta1 * m + (1 - self.beta1) * grad self.cache_v[id] = self.beta2 * v + (1 - self.beta2) * grad ** 2 # bias-corrected variable m_corrected = self.cache_m[id] / (1 - self.beta1 ** t) v_corrected = self.cache_v[id] / (1 - self.beta2 ** t) self.cache_t[id] = t + 1 # delta calculation delta = self.lr * m_corrected / (np.sqrt(v_corrected) + self.eps) return delta . .

Early stopping at epoch 72 . I will now plot the performance of the model as training progressed, to potentially spot any irregularities or issues. . Apart from the occassional spike, the loss did decrease exponentially and begin to converge, therefore the model has successfully trained. . MAE (41,696) is 18.81% of mean RMSE (65,708) is 29.64% of mean MAPE 23.26% R2 Score is 0.838 . The from-scratch multilayer perceptron model performed better than expected, and outperformed the XGBoost and Random Forest. I see this model as a great success and I will now be comparing all the tested models directly and making a judgement as to what to use in the final app. . Conclusion . r2 mape .

XGBoost(ADJ) 0.832487 | 18.801916 | . MultilayerPerceptron 0.838236 | 23.260539 | . As the above shows, the XGBoost slightly outperforms the Multilayer Perceptron model. However, since the XGBoost model was taken directly from a library, and the MLP was implemented from scratch, I will choose to export the MLP for the final model. Additionally, the XGBoost model is limited to predictions within its observed set, in other words it cannot extrapolate, whereas the MLP can; therefore, I believe the Multilayer Perceptron to be ideal in this case. . SOURCE = &quot;models/MultilayerPerceptron.bin&quot; DESTINATION = os.path.join(SERVER_DIR, &quot;model.bin&quot;) os.system(f&quot;cp {SOURCE} {DESTINATION}&quot;); . Since I want to use conformal prediction, I will also pre-calibrate and export the calibration scores to the server directory. By calibrating beforehand, I will not need to calibrate the model in the server, avoiding any intensive computation on the Heroku server-side, which could use resources not available to free users. . calibrated = ConformalRegression(load(SOURCE)).calibrate(cal_X, cal_y.reshape(-1,1)) dump(calibrated.resid_, os.path.join(SERVER_DIR, &quot;conf_resid.bin&quot;)); . In conclusion, I have selected to use the MLP model alongside conformal prediction techniques as the predictive model behind my house price valuation tool. Now, I need to implement and potentially deploy the actual front-end app to serve these predictions. .",

However, a table of the data points is not very helpful in analysis, therefore I will do some visualisation first. . Dataset as a time series . I will begin by visualising the dataset with the median monthly housing price as plotted through time. . As shown, the average price of a property has grown, almost exponentially, throughout the years. This behaviour could be leveraged by a prediction model, however for ideal predictions, this needs to be stationarised as to be able to make predictions regardless of the time the training data was observed. . Detrending dataset . In order to be able to predict the price of a property regardless of time, I need to detrend/stationarise the prices using the house price index. I will use the adjusted prices for the sample outputs in non-extrapolation models (such as decision tree ensembles), as well as visualisation and outlier removal. Additionally, I will add the HPI and data as features and will use the raw prices as outputs for extrapolation models that can learn the time correlation instead. . To adjust the prices: $$ textit{Adjusted price} = frac{ textit{Price in y}}{ textit{y index}} $$ Where, $y$ : Date of observation . To bring the adjusted price back to the current date, or any date for that matter, we simply need to multiply by the index of the target date: $$ textit{Price in x} = textit{x index} times textit{Adjusted price} = textit{x index} times frac{ textit{Price in y}}{ textit{y index}} $$ Where, $x$ : Target date $y$ : Date of observation . hpi = pd.read_csv(HPI_PATH, parse_dates=[&quot;Date&quot;]).set_index(&quot;Date&quot;).Index hpi.plot().set_title(&quot;House Price Index&quot;); . idx = pd.DatetimeIndex(df.index.values.astype(&quot;datetime64[M]&quot;)) # converting date of transfers to start of month dates # filling any missing dates in house price index missing = idx.unique()[~idx.unique().isin(hpi.index)] if len(missing) &gt; 0: hpi = pd.concat([hpi, pd.Series(index=missing, dtype=&quot;float64&quot;)]).fillna(method=&quot;bfill&quot;) # backfill nans with previous index values hpi_reindexed = hpi[idx].values # map df dates to multipliers df.insert(0, &quot;PRICE_ADJ&quot;, df.PRICE.values / hpi_reindexed) # adjusting prices: price * multiplier . df[&quot;MONTH&quot;] = df.index.month df[&quot;YEAR&quot;] = df.index.year df[&quot;HPI&quot;] = hpi[idx].values . I will now visualise the inflation-adjusted time series, as compared to the original. . The effects of the 2008 financial crisis are very apparent, and we can see more recent instability in house prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic - as it drastically breaks from the seasonal pattern in 2020. Additionally, there is a visible seasonality in the series, as we see a rise in price towards summer months, and a fall in the winter. . Feature engineering . Now, I will transform the dataset so that it is more interpretable by a machine learning algorithm; esentially, I need to convert the dataset to numeric values instead of strings. I will also reduce some of the dimensionality currently present in the data; including the cardinality of the categorical columns, and the number of features in the dataset. . Geospatial information . Currently, the postcode of a property is completely uninterpretable by a predictive model. In order to still leverage this useful location data, I will transform my dataset by using external coordinate data instead. . pcdLookup = ( pd.read_csv(PCD_PATH) # data/raw/postcode-lookup.csv .set_index(&quot;PCDS&quot;) ) pcdLookup.head() .

To show the significance of the coordinate data in relation to this dataset, I will produce a scatter plot of the coordinates with a colour map of the price. . The plot shows a very clear relationship between location and price; further south, towards London, the price of a property is largely significantly higher than in the north. This behaviour will be very useful for a model to learn, and will probably be the most helpful features in the dataset. . Categorical data . Categorical data can be very useful to a predictive model, if the categories are formatted properly. Since all the data passed into the algorithms must be numerical, the categorical columns must be encoded to integer/float values. One way of doing this is One-hot Encoding where each category in a column is binary mapped to a zero or one. However, one-hot encoding each category will lead to an extremely high dimensionality, since each individual categorical column will be mapped to several new columns. Therefore, I will be using Ordinal Encoding, which will number/rank the categories instead. Before doing this, I will reduce the high cardinality in the data by removing categories in columns with low counts, and merging categories where appropriate. . for col in df.select_dtypes(&quot;category&quot;): df[col] = df[col].cat.remove_unused_categories() . Tidying categories and reducing cardinality . I will begin by tidying up the PROPERTY_TYPE and BUILT_FORM columns. . print(df.PROPERTY_TYPE.value_counts()) df = df[df.PROPERTY_TYPE !=&quot;Park home&quot;] # Park home category only has 19 records df[&quot;PROPERTY_TYPE&quot;] = df.PROPERTY_TYPE.cat.remove_unused_categories() print(&quot; nPROPERTY_TYPE - New categories:&quot;, list(df.PROPERTY_TYPE.cat.categories)) .

I will now use the columns to make a new property type column which is perhaps more useful. Ultimately, the &quot;usefulness&quot; of this column will be determined by feature selection but it could be better than the other two on their own. The &quot;Flat&quot; and &quot;Maisonette&quot; categories will not be coupled with their accompanying built form category types as, logically, it doesn&#39;t make much sense. . prp_map = { (&quot;House&quot;,&quot;Detached&quot;): &quot;Detached house&quot;, (&quot;House&quot;,&quot;Semi-Detached&quot;): &quot;Semi-detached house&quot;, (&quot;House&quot;,&quot;Terrace&quot;): &quot;Terrace house&quot;, (&quot;Bungalow&quot;,&quot;Detached&quot;): &quot;Detached bungalow&quot;, (&quot;Bungalow&quot;,&quot;Semi-Detached&quot;): &quot;Semi-detached bungalow&quot;, (&quot;Bungalow&quot;,&quot;Terrace&quot;): &quot;Terrace bungalow&quot;, (&quot;Flat&quot;,&quot;Detached&quot;): &quot;Flat&quot;, (&quot;Flat&quot;,&quot;Semi-Detached&quot;): &quot;Flat&quot;, (&quot;Flat&quot;,&quot;Terrace&quot;): &quot;Flat&quot;, (&quot;Maisonette&quot;,&quot;Detached&quot;): &quot;Maisonette&quot;, (&quot;Maisonette&quot;,&quot;Semi-Detached&quot;): &quot;Maisonette&quot;, (&quot;Maisonette&quot;,&quot;Terrace&quot;): &quot;Maisonette&quot;, } df[&quot;N_PROPERTY_TYPE&quot;] = list(zip(df.PROPERTY_TYPE, df.BUILT_FORM)) df[&quot;N_PROPERTY_TYPE&quot;] = df.N_PROPERTY_TYPE.map(prp_map).astype(&quot;category&quot;) print(&quot;N_PROPERTY_TYPE - categories:&quot;, list(df.N_PROPERTY_TYPE.cat.categories)) .

I will encode the categories within a column by ranking them in order based on their average property price.

The categorical variables have been assigned increasing integers corresponding to their effect on the price, and the OLD_NEW column has essentially been binary encoded. However, the ranked order for the CONSTRUCTION_AGE_BAND column does not make logical sense; therefore I will rank the categories in chronological order instead. . mappings[&quot;CONSTRUCTION_AGE_BAND&quot;] = { k: i for i, k in enumerate( [&quot;before 1900&quot;, *list(df.CONSTRUCTION_AGE_BAND.cat.categories)[:-1]] ) } mappings[&quot;CONSTRUCTION_AGE_BAND&quot;] . {&#39;before 1900&#39;: 0, &#39;1900-1929&#39;: 1, &#39;1930-1949&#39;: 2, &#39;1950-1966&#39;: 3, &#39;1967-1975&#39;: 4, &#39;1976-1982&#39;: 5, &#39;1983-1990&#39;: 6, &#39;1991-1995&#39;: 7, &#39;1996-2002&#39;: 8, &#39;2003-2006&#39;: 9, &#39;2007 onwards&#39;: 10} . for col, map_ in mappings.items(): df[col] = df[col].map(map_) df.head() .

Distribution and Skewness . Skewed data can be described as data where the distribution curve appears to be asymmetrical. Skewed data can either be left-skewed or right-skewed. Data with right skew (positive skew) will have a mean &gt; median &gt; mode. Data with left skew (negative skew) will have a mean &lt; median &lt; mode. . . Skewed data can adversely affect a model&#39;s performance especially in regression-based models, such as linear regression, where the model assumes the data follows normal distribution and has no outliers. Therefore, the model can tend to favour more extreme values, rather than values which are within the true range. Tree-based models, which I may use, are not susceptible to this sort of situation, however, in order to try other models as a possibility, I will need to transform the data to properly balance it. . skew = [&quot;PRICE_ADJ&quot;, &quot;TOTAL_FLOOR_AREA&quot;, &quot;NUMBER_HABITABLE_ROOMS&quot;] df[skew].skew() . PRICE_ADJ 264.080204 TOTAL_FLOOR_AREA 270.696094 NUMBER_HABITABLE_ROOMS 2.919180 dtype: float64 . The graph clearly shows extreme positive-skew in the price, floor area, room, and crime columns. Since the dataset should ideally follow normal distribution, I will &quot;unskew&quot; this data by removing outliers and potentially transforming the data for a better distribution. . Outliers . I will detect outliers by filtering values according to their percentile within the dataset. A data point outside of a given percentile range will be interpreted as an outlier value and will be removed. . def PercentileOutliers(x, llim, ulim): x = np.asarray(x) if x.ndim == 2: # converting numeric parameter to list of [numeric parameter] if isinstance(llim, (int, float)): llim = [llim] * x.shape[1] if isinstance(ulim, (int, float)): ulim = [ulim] * x.shape[1] # llim/ulim is a list of percentiles with length of input columns lower = np.array( [np.percentile(x[:, i], llim[i]) for i in range(x.shape[1])]) upper = np.array( [np.percentile(x[:, i], ulim[i]) for i in range(x.shape[1])]) else: if not isinstance(llim, (int, float)): raise ValueError(f&quot;Provide a numeric `llim` for 1-d data not {type(llim)}&quot;) if not isinstance(ulim, (int, float)): raise ValueError(f&quot;Provide a numeric `ulim` for 1-d data not {type(ulim)}&quot;) lower = np.percentile(x, llim) upper = np.percentile(x, ulim) return (lower &lt; x) &amp; (x &lt; upper) # returning mask with shape of array `x` . l = len(df) df = df[PercentileOutliers( df[skew], # [price, area, rooms] llim = [1, 5, 0], ulim = [99, 95, 98] ).all(axis=1) # A row must contain no outliers to be included in the dataset ] print(f&quot;{len(df):,} rows, {l-len(df):,} rows removed&quot;) . 4,903,637 rows, 653,647 rows removed .

I will now save the new dataset; the non-interpretable string categories have now been encoded into numeric values, and much of the outliers and instability has been removed, therefore, the data has been successfully formatted in a way in which a model can understand it to produce predictions. . json.dump({k.lower(): mappings[k] for k in df.select_dtypes(&quot;category&quot;).columns}, open(os.path.join(SERVER_DIR, &quot;encoding.json&quot;), &quot;w&quot;), indent=2) # Saving mappings for remaining categorical columns df = df.dropna() df.to_parquet(DATASET_PATH) .",

            "title": "ML Instant House Valuation: Part 1 - Analysis",
            "content": "I will be creating a house valuation web app which will allow a user to input a set of property features (such as the number of rooms, floor size, property age etc.) and be given an instant valuation based on a machine learning solution. The idea began by brainstorming a number of machine learning related tools; first a weather forecasting tool, then a stock price predictor, but finally I settled with a house price valuation tool. I found it more interesting to be forced to build, analyse and develop a solution myself, as there was very limited material for this project online. The project began more as a research task but I decided to develop it as a web service, after stumbling across this Diamond price prediction project (now inactive) online. . Current systems analysis . To get an idea of how my system should function, I will take a look at popular pre-existing house valuation tools. Ideally I would like an indication to the data and methods the tools use, however it is unlikely that I will be able to. The UI and aesthetics is not my main concern in the analysis, but I will also follow and expand on some of the design components that are similar between them all. . Zoopla . . I like Zooplaâs system as it is very simple to use and understand, its UI is visually appealing, and it includes other data apart from just the valuation, such as local amneties, making it even more helpful to an end user. The Zoopla valuation uses data already on its databases to instantly valuate the property. Its additional data sources, such as the HM Land Registry, are also provided, which is ideal for my problem as it will allow me to explore and potentially use datasets from the same reliable sources. Unlike Zoopla, I will adopt a system where the end user is asked for the propertyâs location as well as other property features, such as its total square footage etc., which allow for the valuation of properties that possibly donât even exist. Additionally, I will provide the last sold price if the input property does exist, similar to how Zoopla does. . Yopa . . I like the simplicity of the Yopa valuation, however only requiring the number of bedrooms and location doesnât seem like it would yield a very accurate result. In my system, I would ideally require at least 5 features for the resulting estimation. Yopa, similar to Zoopla, also implements a low and high estimation alongside its valuation, and I will also attempt to implement this. . OnTheMarket . . I particularly like the UI and aesthetic which OnTheMarketâs online valuation system uses. The predicted prices seem to be based on location averages, which I may also implement in my system alongside the machine learning aspect. Additionally, the system requires 15 features in addition to the location, which makes the valuation seem more accurate to the end user, unlike the Yopa valuation which only required the number of bedrooms. I will however reduce the number of required features, and keep all my parameters on a single page, to make the process somewhat easier. I will source data which includes similar features such as the property age, number of rooms, property type etc. . End User Questionnaire . I asked 3 home-owners questions on their thoughts of the project and how I should develop it; I think the responses of potential users will be particularly helpful in the direction of which the development of my project goes: . Would you consider an online property valuation as an accurate way to get the price of a property? * Response 1: I would consider an online valuation to get a rough idea of a houseâs value. I would probably use a tool like this before contacting an estate agent to valuate the property in real life. * Response 2: Iâd use an instant valuation tool to see if a property is worth pursuing, it would save a lot of time instead of having to contact somebody myself. * Response 3: I donât think a service like this would be highly accurate but I do think it would give a useful estimation and could give a relatively reliable prediction. | . What characteristics of a property do you think would most impact its valuation? * Response 1: I think the age, size and property type would be useful in telling the price of a house. However, I believe the value of properties in the area would have greatest impact on a houseâs price. _ Response 2: The price of surrounding properties would be the most useful in the valuation of a house, along with its total square footage, number of rooms, and perhaps general local area information like population and crime rate. _ Response 3: The quality of the neighbourhood of a property and the prices of other houses nearby are the most indicative of a propertyâs value. Property features such as the size and the type also impact a propertyâs valuation greatly. | . What additional features would you like to see, alongside the valuation? * Response 1: Iâd like to see the average price of houses in the local area, or perhaps the average price of similar property types. * Response 2: I think itâd be helpful to see local area statistics such as the population and average house price in the area. Additionally, I donât think a point estimation is a very helpful so Iâd like to see an valuation with an associated interval, with a low and high estimation. * Response 3: It would be interesting to get predictions for the price of a property years in the future. It would also be helpful to see the previous sold price of a property. | . How would you like the information displayed to you? * Response 1: Iâd like to see the information displayed as simply as it can, clutter and unnecessary information can be quite annoying - like asking for email and other data that has nothing to do with the actual predictions. I would prefer all the information easily visible in one window. * Response 2: I think displaying a map of the propertyâs area along with its valuation would be helpful, especially for people who consider moving into the area. There should be an option to have the predictions emailed to you, but not as a requirement. * Response 3: A simple web form should suffice for inputting the property details. The output could be given in a separate page or pop-up with all the information. | . In conclusion, the home-owners would consider using the service as a rough estimate for a propertyâs value before seeking professional advice. All 3 participants think that local area information could be useful in the valuation, as well as the property size and type. I liked the idea to include local area statistics in the output to the user, and I agree that unnecessary clutter should be avoided when serving the information to the end user. . Problem Modelling . My initial thoughts on how to approach the problem. I will try implement the system in four (or potentially five) stages: . Stage 1. Data sourcing - collecting and stitching data from various sources to build a large dataset (aiming for around 1 million rows). | Stage 2. Data sanitisation and preprocessing - transforming the dataset and its features to allow for predictive modelling | Stage 3. Model training - testing and training various machine learning models on the dataset to maximise accuracy | Stage 4. Web development - implementing the server and client side for users to access. | (if possible) Stage 5. App deployment - deploying the client-server model to the web for potential use. | . Below covers the general implementation and structure of the project, split into its distinct stages. . . I am currently unclear on what machine learning models to use and how to preprocess the data. These decisions will be made as the data is collected and in exploratory data analysis. I will fit multiple models on the dataset and test their performance to pick an algorithm, I may also ensemble/stack multiple models if it proves useful. I may need a database for features of the model which require context from the inputs provided by the end user, such as geospatial or local area data. . The web service itself, which will serve the predictions to the end user, will look somewhere along the lines of: . . Drawing inspiration from the Zoopla and OnTheMarket user interfaces, with a simple form, an interval prediction, and a map of the area using Google Maps API. . Algorithms . Conformal prediction . Conformal prediction is a technique used to assess the uncertainty of predictions produced by a machine learning model. In particular, given an input, conformal prediction estimates a prediction interval in regression problems and a set of classes in classification problems. Both the prediction interval and sets cover the true value with high probability (usually provided by the user). Steps to producing a conformal prediction model: . Identify a score function to measure the discrepancy between model outputs $ hat y$ and expected outputs $y$. This metric is critical as it decides what prediction sets can be obtained. For instance, in regression problems, we could take the absolute error $ left | hat y - y right | $ as the score function. | . | Compute nonconformity scores for the model by splitting the training set into a proper set and calibration set. The model is only trained on the proper training set; and scores are computed on the calibration set where $S_n = S( hat y_n, y_n)$ for the $n$th sample. | Prediction - use the underlying algorithm to make a point prediction $ hat y$ and take the ($1 - alpha$)th quantile $Q$ from the score set - where $ alpha$ is a user-provided significance level. Output $ hat y pm Q$ as the modelâs prediction. | Stochastic gradient descent and linear regression . Regression models are used to describe relationships between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable. The model makes assumptions about the dataset: . Homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity) - the observations in the dataset must be about the same distance from the regression line. . ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Heteroscedascity_vs_Homoscedascity.png/640px-Heteroscedascity_vs_Homoscedascity.png . | Independence of observations - there are no hidden relationships among independent variables. | Normality - the data follows a normal distribution. | Linearity - the line of best fit through the data points is a straight line, not some polynomial/exponential curve | . Multiple linear regression generalises a dataset as the output being a weighted summation of its inputs. . y^i=b+âk=0nwkxik hat y_i = b + sum^n_{k=0} w_k x_{ik} y^âiâ=b+k=0ânâwkâxikâ . In matrix form, it can be written as a dot product, as shown: . y^=wâx+b hat y = w cdot x + by^â=wâx+b . Where, $ hat y$: predicted $x$: independent variables vector $w$: coefficients vector i.e weights $b$: constant term i.e bias . The stochastic gradient descent algorithm is used to adjust the weights and bias for the model. The algorithm requires a differentiable cost function in order to derive the gradients of each adjustable parameter. I will be using the half mean squared cost function, as it will differentiate nicely making it a lot easier to implement. The cost function is defined as such, . J(w,b)=12nâi=1n(wxi+bâyi)2J(w,b) = frac 1{2n} sum_{i=1}^n(wx_i + b - y_i)^2J(w,b)=2n1âi=1ânâ(wxiâ+bâyiâ)2 . The goal is to find the values of the $w$ and $b$ terms which minimise the error. This can be done by taking the partial derivative (gradient) of the cost function $J$ with respect each parameter, . âJâb=1nâi=1n(y^iâyi)âJâw=1nâi=1nxi(y^iâyi)=1nxâ(y^ây) frac { partial J}{ partial b} = frac 1n sum_{i=1}^n ( hat{y}_i - y_i) frac { partial J}{ partial w} = frac 1n sum_{i=1}^n x_i( hat{y}_i - y_i) = frac 1n x cdot ( hat{y} - y)âbâJâ=n1âi=1ânâ(y^âiââyiâ)âwâJâ=n1âi=1ânâxiâ(y^âiââyiâ)=n1âxâ(y^âây) . Where $ eta$ is the learning rate, iteratively update the parameters until they converge, . b:=bâÎ·ââbw:=wâÎ·ââwb := b - eta cdot partial b w := w - eta cdot partial wb:=bâÎ·ââbw:=wâÎ·ââw . The implementation of linear regression with stochastic gradient descent will be a great starting point when implementing the more complex multilayer perceptron model, which similarly uses the weighted summation function to make predictions and a gradient descent algorithm to optimise its parameters. . Multilayer Perceptron . . A multilayer perceptron is a feed-forward neural network consisting of at least three layers of nodes; an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. . . The input layer receives an input signal to be processed. The modelâs prediction is performed by the output layer. The hidden layers between the input and output layer are the computational engine of the model. MLPs can be used to approximate any continuous function, and can solve problems which are not linearly separable by using non-linear activation functions. . An MLP learns in two stages: . Forward propagation, where data is fed from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. For a general model of $L$ layers with weights $W$ and activation functions $ sigma$, forward propagation can be expressed as a function composition as shown: F(x)=ÏN(WLâÏLâ1(WLâ1â¯Ï2(W2âÏ1(W1âx))â¯â))F(x) = sigma_N(W_L cdot sigma_{L-1}(W_{L-1} cdots sigma_2(W_2 cdot sigma_1(W_1 cdot x)) cdots)) F(x)=ÏNâ(WLââÏLâ1â(WLâ1ââ¯Ï2â(W2ââÏ1â(W1ââx))â¯)) | Backpropagation, where by using the chain rule, the partial derivatives of the loss function w.r.t. the various weights and biases are fed back through the network from the output layer through to the input layer. The differentiation produces a gradient along which the parameters may be adjusted towards the minima. See Backpropagation algorithm for more detail. . . | . These stages are repeated until the loss converges towards a minimum. . Backpropagation algorithm . Backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training feed-forward neural networks used to compute the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of a network for a training set of input-output examples. The gradient computed by backpropagation can be used with other algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (or its derivatives) to update the weights and minimise error in a network. . Below shows the mathematical logic behind the algorithm. The following example is for a feed-forward network of $L$ layers. . F(x)=ÏN(WLâÏLâ1(WLâ1â¯Ï2(W2âÏ1(W1âx))â¯â))Cost=J(y,F(x))F(x) = sigma_N(W_L cdot sigma_{L-1}(W_{L-1} cdots sigma_2(W_2 cdot sigma_1(W_1 cdot x)) cdots)) Cost = J(y, F(x))F(x)=ÏNâ(WLââÏLâ1â(WLâ1ââ¯Ï2â(W2ââÏ1â(W1ââx))â¯))Cost=J(y,F(x)) . For the model above, the derivative of the loss w.r.t. the input $x$ using the chain rule is generalised as such: . ChainÂ rule:F(x)=f(g(x))Fâ²(x)=fâ²(g(x))âgâ²(x)derivativeÂ ofÂ compoundÂ function=derivativeÂ ofÂ outerÂ functionÃderivativeÂ ofÂ innerÂ functionâ´dJdx=dJdaLâÏLâ²âWLâÏLâ1â²âWLâ1â¯âÏ1â²âW1 text{Chain rule}: F(x) = f(g(x)) qquad F&amp;#x27;(x) = f&amp;#x27;(g(x)) cdot g&amp;#x27;(x) { small text{derivative of compound function} = text{derivative of outer function} times text{derivative of inner function}} [1em] therefore quad frac{dJ}{dx} = frac{dJ}{da_L} circ sigma_L&amp;#x27; cdot W_L circ sigma_{L-1}&amp;#x27; cdot W_{L-1} cdots circ sigma_1&amp;#x27; cdot W_1ChainÂ rule:F(x)=f(g(x))Fâ²(x)=fâ²(g(x))âgâ²(x)derivativeÂ ofÂ compoundÂ function=derivativeÂ ofÂ outerÂ functionÃderivativeÂ ofÂ innerÂ functionâ´dxdJâ=daLâdJââÏLâ²ââWLââÏLâ1â²ââWLâ1ââ¯âÏ1â²ââW1â . The gradient $ nabla$ is the transpose of the derivative of the loss w.r.t. the input, therefore, the matrices are transposed and the order of multiplication is reversed, such that: . âxJ=W1TâÏ1â²â¯âWLâ1TâÏLâ1â²âWLTâÏLâ²ââaLJ nabla_xJ = W_1^T cdot sigma_1&amp;#x27; cdots circ W_{L-1}^T cdot sigma_{L-1}&amp;#x27; circ W_L^T cdot sigma_L&amp;#x27; circ nabla_{a_L}JâxâJ=W1TââÏ1â²ââ¯âWLâ1TââÏLâ1â²ââWLTââÏLâ²âââaLââJ . The backpropagation consists of then evaluating this expression from right to left, i.e starting from the output layer, computing the gradient at each layer on the way. To avoid unneccessary repeated computation of expressions, we can introduce a new variable $ delta_l$, the âerror at layer $l$â. This variable is a vector with length of the number of nodes in its associated layer. Each value can be interpreted as the loss attributable to that node for the given input-output sample. $ delta_l$ can then be computed recursively, starting backwards from layer $L rightarrow 1$, such that: Î´lâ1:=Ïlâ1â²âWlTâÎ´l delta_{l-1} := sigma_{l-1}&amp;#x27; circ W_l^T cdot delta_lÎ´lâ1â:=Ïlâ1â²ââWlTââÎ´lâ The gradients of the weights can then be calculated, such that: âWlJ=Î´lâalâ1T nabla_{W_l}J = delta_l cdot a_{l-1}^TâWlââJ=Î´lââalâ1Tâ Finally, the weights be updated (demonstrated here with stochastic gradient descent), such that: . Wl:=WlâÎ·ââWlJW_l := W_l - eta cdot nabla_{W_l}J Wlâ:=WlââÎ·ââWlââJ . Where, $L$ : Number of layers in network $ sigma$ : Non-linear activation function $J$ : Loss function taking parameters $y$ (expected output), and $ hat y$ (actual output) $W_l$ : Weight matrix of $l$th layer; all the connections between nodes in current and next layer. $a_l$ : Activated output of $l$th layer $ delta_l$ : Error at $l$th layer $ eta$ : Learning rate of SGD algorithm $A^T$ : Transpose of matrix $A$ $ nabla_ba$ : Gradient of $a$ w.r.t $b$ $ circ$ : Hadamard (element-wise) matrix multiplication, products taken from left to right . CART algorithm . The CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used to build a decision tree (as a predictive model) to predict the output of a given sample, using attributes observed in a given training set. The model is very intuitive and easy to interpret/explain. . . Furthermore, it is robust and does not require any prior normalisation or scaling of the dataset. It is also unaffected by outliers and finds important variables automatically, unlike linear regression models. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting, and small changes to the dataset can cause a large change in tree structure causing instability. The algorithm, while can be modelled to perform the task, is inadequate for applying regression and predicting continuous values, and cannot extrapolate beyond its observed set. To mitigate some of these issues, decision trees are often used in ensemble methods including random forests and gradient boosting machines, which aim to reduce overfitting. . The algorithm performs binary splits using the features of a dataset to build a tree, until all of the nodes are ideally âpureâ. . . Optimal splits are found by comparing the impurity of multiple potential splits. Popular metrics used to measure impurity are: . Gini impurity (classification) - calculates the probability that a specific feature is classified incorrectly when selected randomly. A pure node of gini index 0 indicates that all its contained elements are of one unique class. . Gini=1ââk=1nPk2 textit{Gini} = 1 - sum^n_{k=1}P_k^2Gini=1âk=1ânâPk2â Where $P_i$ is the probability of class $k$. . | Variance reduction (regression) - variance is used for calculating the homogeneity of a node. If a node is entirely homogeneous, i.e pure, then the variance is zero. Var(y)=1nâi=1n(yiâyË)2 textit{Var}(y) = frac 1n sum^n_{i=1}(y_i- bar y)^2 Var(y)=n1ââi=1nâ(yiââyËâ)2 Where $ bar y$ is the mean of input data $y$ . | . To determine the quality of a split using some impurity metric, we use information gain, which can be described as the reduction of information entropy $H$ from a prior state (parent node) to a new state (split into children nodes): . Gain=EntropyÂ ofÂ parentÂ nodeâAverageÂ entropyÂ ofÂ childrenÂ nodesIG(p,l,r)=H(p)â1np[nlH(l)+nrH(r)] text{Gain} = text{Entropy of parent node} - text{Average entropy of children nodes} IG(p,l,r) = H(p) - frac 1{n_p} [n_lH(l) + n_rH(r)]Gain=EntropyÂ ofÂ parentÂ nodeâAverageÂ entropyÂ ofÂ childrenÂ nodesIG(p,l,r)=H(p)ânpâ1â[nlâH(l)+nrâH(r)] . Where, $p$: parent node $l$: left subtree $r$: right subtree $n_x$: number of elements in a set $x$ $H(x)$: entropy metric function . The algorithm starts at the root node, with the entire dataset. It then compares potential splits (all permutations of features and unique thresholds) and chooses the split with the highest information gain. It then recursively repeats this process on the its resulting splits until the nodes are pure, or until the process is stopped manually. The algorithm is stopped by user specified parameters, such as when the tree grows to a maximum depth provided or if a split produces a minimum number of samples. . Random forest . Random forests are a bagging ensemble learning method which construct multiple decision trees at training time. In the bagging method, also known as bootstrap aggregation, a random sample from the training set is selected with replacement - allowing data points to be used multiple times. After several data samples are generated, a number of estimators are then individually trained. When making a prediction, outputs from each indiviual tree are aggregated to yield a more accurate result; for regression the mean is taken, and for classification the majority vote. . . Gradient boosting machine . Gradient boosting is a boosting ensemble learning method that combines a set of weak learners (decision trees) into a single strong learner to minimise training errors. In boosting, a random sample of data is selected, fitted with a model and trained sequentially; each model tries to improve the errors of its predecessor, by training on the previous predictorâs residual errors. The method combines both the gradient descent and boosting methods, hence the name gradient boosting. . . API and HTTP requests . . Throughout my project I will make multiple web requests to; . scrape data from the web | download datasets programatically | make API requests with postcodes.io to validate and geocode user input. | make API requests with Google Maps for illustration purposes. | Additionally, I will use a small internal API within my project to connect the Python backend and the HTML/JavaScript frontend. | . Objectives . In my project I aim to accomplish several things: . Provide the user with reliable and accurate predictions: 1.1. Building a comprehensive dataset with easily interpretable features while not limiting model performance: 1.1.1. Cardinality reduction (reducing number of categories and options) | 1.1.2. Outlier removal | 1.1.3. Moderate number of features (not too many, nor too few) | . | 1.2. Updated predictions regardless of date of training observations: 1.2.1. Inflation adjustment | 1.2.2. Time features | . | 1.4. Implement, test, and evaluate between a selection of different models, using the best model in the web-app. | 1.5. Provide a prediction interval, for which the true value is highly probable to lie within using conformal regression techniques. | . | Serve predictions to the user in a web app: 2.1. Use postcodes.io to validate postcodes with a fallback regex test. | 2.2. Geocode postcodes to corresponding coordinates, again utilising the postcodes.io API. | 2.3. Use Google Maps API to visualise the area, using the given postcode. | 2.4. Responsive design, allowing fast accessibility across all devices and screen sizes: 2.4.1. Limiting dependencies and not over-engineering (using only Bootstrap and jQuery) | 2.4.2. Using different layouts/breakpoints according to screen size. | . | 2.5. Display outputs and errors with maximum readability and ease: 2.5.1. Aesthetically consistent | 2.5.2. Subtle micro-animations | 2.5.3. Limited colour pallete | . | . | Deploy the web app across the internet: 3.1. Use GitHub for source control | 3.2. Use Heroku for app deployment, automatically rebuilding the site as the GitHub repo is updated. | . | Limitations . My project will be confronted with some limitations: . It is impossible for the prediction model to predict the price of a property exactly, however, the answers to the questionnaire show that this is not what users want, rather they want an estimate which is roughly accurate. | Computational limitations/requirements, such as resource usage in Heroku and hardware constraints of the machine used in training, means that I will have to limit the complexity and size of the prediction models. Doing this could possibly train models which underperform, compared to their actual potential. | Due to the subjective nature of house valuations, it is difficult to confirm whether a valuation is actually accurate or not; apart from empirically comparing a prediction with its actual sold price. However, the sold price may not be indicative of the actual price as the property could have sold under or over value. Therefore, I will also compare a number of valuations with similar alternative tools, alongside the empirical tests used in model selection. | Feasability of potential solutions . To build predictive models, I could have used multiple languages, most notably: . Python - Python is widely used for data science and web development, both which my project entail. With its simple syntax and large ecosystem containing a wide selection of libraries built for data science, Python is an ideal solution. However, due to dynamic typing and being an interpreted language, it suffers from performance issues. Despite this, the language supports importing directly from C, which major Python libraries like NumPy are built in; therefore, we can leverage the speed of C whilst still using Python. Although, custom implementations will still be relatively slow, especially the recursive decision tree model. | Java - Java is also a strong contender as it is very fast, is well supported and has a huge ecosystem. Additionally, the language is secure due it use of bytecode that is run on Java Virtual Machines. However, JVMs cause Java to have greater memory and processing requirements, making it more expensive on older/slower devices. | R - The R programming language is a graphic-based language used for statistical computing, analysis, and visualisation in machine learning. It is better suited for research papers and reports, and isnât built for large-scale use. | . I will be using Python over Java, as I am more proficient with it and am able to dive directly into programming the project, rather than learning the concepts and syntax, as I would have to with Java. Additionally, many of the libraries suited for data science and machine learning in Java often try mirroring the semantics of their Python equivalents, therefore Iâd find it easier and better to just stick to Python. . Additionally, I will build an isolated front end using a simple HTML-JavaScript stack, rather than overengineering with frameworks such as React and Vue. Using frameworks and libraries would introduce unneccessary complexity and could overall hinder the performance of the somewhat small project that I am creating, instead of providing any real benefit. . Some key technologies I will be using in Python for different stages of the project are: . NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and modelling | Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation | Flask for the server/backend. | . In the frontend I will be utilising: . JQuery - a small JavaScript library to make HTML event handling and document traversal much simpler to handle, therefore speeding up development. | SASS - a CSS extension to reduce code repetition, used for styling the user interface. | . Data . I will require vast amounts of housing data, with hundreds of thousands of rows, to build a predictive model that can accurately valuate a given property. Additionally, I am aiming to build a dataset with around 6-10 features (columns), therefore I will require around 30 features total to select the best from. As such, I will be collecting and stitching together data from multiple public sources, aiming to build a dataset of ideally around a million rows, however anything above 250,000 rows will suffice. I will be using: . HM Land Registry Price Paid data - just under 4GB, with millions of rows of data, containing details of each transactions received at HM Land Registry since 1 January 1995. | Energy Performance Certificates data - around 10GB, with millions of rows of data spread across multiple files and folders formatted as such: all-domestic-certificates/{LSOA}-{CITY}/certificates.csv. The data contains several columns about a propertyâs different attributes and energy efficiency. | ONS National Statistics Postcode Lookup - dataset mapping every UK postcode to its respective geographic coordinates, LSOA (Lower Super Output Area) code, and various other attributes. | National Statistics UK House Price Index - time series dataset recording the HPI on a monthly basis since 1995. | . Since some of the data is extremely large, I will utilise parallel processing and vectorization with Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Dask Dataframes, to process and manipulate the data. Additionally, I will store data locally on the training machine (i.e my computer) in .parquet file format as it is built to support very efficient compression and encoding schemes, making read/write speeds faster and more bearable. Furthermore, I will avoid deploying any of the data to the hosting server in order to minimise resource usage and stay under limits; this includes predictive models (like tree models) which store the data within them. . The app itself will leverage public APIs to convert user-inputted postcodes to latitude/longitude coordinates hence eliminating the need to build a server-side database to store such data. . Ultimately, this project does not require a database, or related structures, to store any type of end-user data as most of the projectâs data aspect is in the optimisation and pre-computation of algorithms before users are even in the picture. .",
